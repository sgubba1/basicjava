DIFFERENCE BETWEEN METHOD AND CONSTRUCTOR
- method name = class name for constructor
- no return type

CONSTRUCTOR OVERLOADING
class Student{
        String name;
        int age;
        Student(String name){

CONSTRUCTOR NAMING
- only used when creating a object

DEFINING VS. CALLING METHODS
Define (Student Class)= name, inputs (bookname), outputs (none), instructions (readBook)
Calling (application) = follow the instructions (readBook Harry Potter)
            this.name = name;
        }
        Student(String name, int age){
            this.name = name;
            this.age = age;
        }
    }
  ----------------------------
    class Application{
        public static void main(String[] args){
            Student s1 = new Student("Joe");        // Uses the first constructor which takes only name
            Student s2 = new Student("Joe", 13);    // Uses the second constructor which takes both name and age.
        }

METHODS CALLING METHODS
Method x calls 4 other methods. 
 void readBook(String bookName){
            checkOutFromLibrary(bookName);
            readTheBook(bookName);
  void checkOutFromLibrary(String bookName){
            System.out.println("Checking out book:" + bookName + " from library");
        }

        void readTheBook(String bookName){
            System.out.println("Read the book out book:" + bookName + " now");   
        }

PRIVATE VOID - hiding details
- Allows the instruction to only be used inside the same class

ENCAPSULATION
- packaging related things
- Hiding details
