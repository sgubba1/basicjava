This is my first session notes. Due to being out of town for more than a week, I will be turning it in late.

Computer - A combination of hardware and software

Hardware - Parts you can touch (mouse, motherboard, hard disk)
CPU - brain of computer - gives the quick answers
RAM - memory of computer - like scratch pad - temporary work is here
Hard Disk - storing information - book - permanent work is here

Software - Instructions and Data, program
Operator - Turning computer on and off (Windows,HP)
Program - set of instructions (Read (action or instruction) Harry Potter book for 30 minutes (rest is data).

Decimal System - ones, tens, hundreds place (32: (3*10) + (2*1))
Binary - 0-1, Base 2 so, 1,2,4,8,16..
Binary to Decimal: 100110 would be 38 in decimal form. Since it basically 32+4+2 = 38
Decimal to Binary: Split 38 into multiples of 2. That would be 32,4,2 and find places of those numbers

Why Binary?
* Computers understand binary - software applications make it easier for us
* Each letter is a specific number like A=65 - the computer sees it as 01000001
 HELLO =  1001000 1000101 1001100 1001100 1001111
