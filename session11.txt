These are my 11th session notes:

Common Mistakes
- remember that a method is like void stop()
- it is NOT the System.out.println("stopping the car" + name):
	-that is an instruction

- objects are the cretion after the cookie cutter - c1.name
- you call them by c1.stop();

CONSTRUCTORS - Use example program
- The point of it is to show that you cannot continue without putting info that is needed

 class Person{
	
    String name;
	
	Person(String inputname){
		name = inputname;
	}

        void printDetails(){
            System.out.println("name is=" + name);
        }
    }

    class Application{
        public static void main(String[] args){
            Person p1 = new Person("sai");
            p1.printDetails();
        }
    }  

- Created name string - inputname is assigned to it too
- To create person you need to do following: 
	Person P1 = new Person("bob")
