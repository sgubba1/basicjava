STATIC METHODS
Static Methods let you conduct the method, even without an object.
Exp: Math.add(20,30)
- Note you cannot put in other info with the static. It will not show up

PREVIOUS NUMBER ADDING
-addSpecial is part of object, so is previousNumber
-add like in the notes would access only class stuff since it's static

REUSING IN JAVA

Second principle of OOPS
-see something, liked most of it, but wanna change a bit
