This is my 6th session notes.

Variable formula: datatype variablename = valueofthevariable;
Exps: int age = 12; String name = "sai"; double cost = 12.5;

CREATING YOUR OWN DATA TYPE:
 Note - you cannot use a  string, double, or int to do more than one variable - that's why we are creating a data type to put all info in one
Exp: Represent a person you should have 5 variables (for _name one variable, age another one etc.,). What we need is a single variable p

Process:
1) Make the first class - not a public static void class 
	-This make the class - You can put variables now
	-You have defined your own data type called Person
	-Synatx - class yourdatatypename{
		Program:  class Person{
  			  } 
2) Insert info in data type.
	-Person will be complete
		Program: 
			class Person{
       			 int age;
        		int name;
        		int grade;
        		int height;
        		int weight;
    			}

UING DATA TYPE:
Process: 
1) Make another class; this one is a public static void class
2) Prin the statement about the description (System.out.println("Person Description:");
3) Define the variable (Person person1;) Person and variable is person1 
4) Add to the line new, (Person person1 = new Person();) This is a new datatype in the class
5) Add the variables. This is the age,name,grade,etc..
	Program: 
		 Person person1 = new Person();
   		 person1.age = 20;
  		 person1.name = "sai";
   		 person1.grade = 7;
   		 person1.height = 5;
   		 person1.weight = 100;
4) Now, to print out statements, do the following for each variable:
	Program: System.out.println( person1.name + " age is:" + person1.age);

COMMON MISTAKES:
-Using variables without saying them before.. (int age;)
-Make sure curly brackets are paired correctly
