Recap
- Write methods
- learned key words

METHOD OVERLOADING:
Class has MORE THAN ONE METHOD WITH SAME NAME as long as they have different order of parameters (String, int)
- Start with application:
 public class Application{
        public static void main(String[] args){
            System.out.println("We are going to learn method overloading today");
- Create Student
  public class Student{
        string name;
        Student(String name){
            this.name = name;
- Reading Book VOID
 public class Student{
        void readBook(String bookName){
            System.out.println("Reading book:" + bookName)

public class Application{
        public static void main(String[] args){
            Student s1 = new Student();
            s1.readBook("Harry Potter");
        }
NOTE: you can add things to the info needed by doing:
void readBook(String bookName, int minutesToRead){
            System.out.println("Reading book:" + bookName + " for " + minutesToRead);

- Giving choice in reading book
Student
void readBook(){
            System.out.println("Reading my own book for whatever minutes I want and pages");
Application
 s1.readBook();      // choice of book, minutes, pages.

Data Types We Know
 String s1 = "Hello";
    int x = 10;
    double d = 10.5;
    boolean result = true;

CHAR
char gender = "F";
