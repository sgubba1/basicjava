This is my 8th session notes.
VOCAB
Class - term for creating data
Object - creating variable (person p1 = new Person();)
Fields - class properties (int age; //field age of type int... accessing fields = p1.age = 16;)
Methods - actions 
	void start(){
		System.out.println("Starting car..");
	}
		....
	// accessing methods
	Car c1 = new Car();
	c1.start();

FIELD AND METHODS - Class has both
	// accessing both of them
	Car.. = new
	c1.name = "BMW";
	c1.start();

CONNECTING FIELDS AND METHODS
Open Eclipse
New Java Project and name it as CarFieldMethodConnectionSample
Create Application (with public static void main checked)
Create Car class
Fill the Car class like below

FIELDS used in program are called OBJECT VARIABLES
- did not have to define name in method start and were able to access it because it is part of class

BOOLEAN!!! - data that bives yes and no
PSEUDO CODE LOGIC
Me: Start car - You: Starting
Me: Strt car - You: You have already starte dcar. Stop before starting again.

start method
    is started
        "sorry you have started already. you need to stop before starting again
    else
        "start" 
        started = true
stop method
    is started
        "stopping"
        started = false
    else
        "sorry,  you have not started yet. please start the car before stopping"
