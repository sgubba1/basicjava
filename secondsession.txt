These are my second notes. I was not here for the second class.
Bit - one binary digit (smallest data)
number of bits - number of values - values
1 (2^1)	2	0-1
2 (2^2)	4	0-3
3 (2^3)	8	0-7
4 (2^4)	16	0-15
5 (2^5)	32	0-31
6 (2^6)	64	0-63
7 (2^7)	128	0-127
8 (2^8)	256	0-128
8 bits fits 256 values - American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) - Binary
info - description
8 bits - 1 bytes
1024 bytes (10^3) - 1 Kilo byte ( it is not 1000 it: is exponent of 2)
1024*1024 bytes (10^6) - 1 Mega byte
1024 * 1024 * 1024 bytes (10^9) - 1 Giga byte
1024 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024 bytes (10^12) - 1 Tera byte

Window OS
Learned about storage in my own laptop
Ram has less storage becasuse the work is not permanent. The hard disk has information that you save so needs more storage.

Folders and Files
File - Group of bytes
Types of files - .txt (text file), .exe (executable are doing stuff files like notepad), .png and .jpg (pics), .html
Folder - collection of files. Can have folers in it too

Eclipse - software that helps develop programs - IDE
IDE: Interactive Development Environment
