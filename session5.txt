This is my fifth session notes:
 INPUT FROM USER PROGRAM - They put in info..

import java.util.Scanner;
public class Application {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.print("first number:");
		Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
		int firstNumber = scanner.nextInt();
		
		System.out.print("second number:");
		int secondNumber = scanner.nextInt();
	}
}

Notes for program:
- variable is scanner - a type of scanner
- nextint() = User Input

Steps for program:
1) Visualize/Understand how the program works.Note the orders, questions, etc.
2) Think about how you are going to solve the program. Use a notebook. Go through some samples of user answers.
3) Start program. Write syntax.
	if(...){
	}else{
		System.out.println(..)
	}
 - if statements are used here for logic. They are boolean exps. so give yes/no ans..

Conditional Programs:
	Division Program
int x = 5;
		int y = 2;
		System.out.println(x/y);

		double x1 = 5;
		double y1 = 2;
		System.out.println(x1/y1);
Answer - 2.5

	Remainder Program
Remainder java program:
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Application {
	public static void main(String[] args) {

		System.out.print("give number:");
		Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
		int number = scanner.nextInt();
		
		// number % 2 is zero it is even
		// else it is odd
		
		if(number %2 == 0) {
			System.out.println(number + " is even");
		}else {
			System.out.println(number + " is odd");
		}
	}
}
- 5 % 2 = 1, 6 % 2 = 0
	Pseudo Logic: 
		is number % 2 value is 0 then
    			 number is even
		otherwise 
    			number is odd

LOOP Program:
Syntax
 for( ;   ;  ){

    }
Description of program - taking a number given by user, and mustiplying it with the numbers 1-10.
	Pseudo Logic: print 10 times starting from 1
		      number = user input
			starting from 1 to 10
			number * counter
Program:
import java.util.*;
public class Application {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
		System.out.println("table number:");
		int number = scanner.nextInt();
		for(int i=1; i<=10; i++) {
			int answer = number * i;
			System.out.println(number + " *" + " " + i + " = " + " " + answer); [the +++ thing is giving the table number like 5 * 2 = 10]
		}
	}
}
	Actual program Logic:
		1) Initialization (i = 1)
		2) Condition (number <= 10)
		3) Increment (i=i+1)
		4) Body of the For (int answer = number * 1; System.out.println(answer);

Eclipse Shortcuts -Cuz life is meant for them..
Short keys make it fatser-
   Exps: 
	New Class - Go to new and click c
	If there is an UNDERLINE under some words in menu bar, you can get to it faster by clicking the underlined letter and ALT
	Alt F - new java project
